# MongoExpressServer
### This is a simple minimal example of how to use ExpressJS and MongoDB to make an API

#### Details

The API was origanlly built with a Vite localhost in mind. If you wish to change it, just change the regex under corsOptions() in server.js You'll need to make a .env file and fill it out with the missing data criteria but other than that mongo should generate the collections if they don't already exist. It uses JWT"s for user authentication.
